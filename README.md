I dev most of the time in <span style="color: 'blue'">py</span><span style="color: 'yellow'">thon</span> (I found it weird at first, now it's my main language for building projects)

Python C API is really solid!

# What I learn / I Want To Learn 📖
- ⚡ Zig is really interesting
- ⚙️ Rust is also interesting (but the compiler seems to be really annoying)
- 👑 Nim looks really cool
- ⌨️ Learning how to use Nvim (of course)

# My Skills 🛠️

# Notes
- Don't think that the "💪👴" is better than "👴", the emojis are a little saracstic, and the "💪" just means "superset"
- Don't worry the emojis are there only because its my profile's presentation, I tough that putting no emojis would be boring and a little sad
- "My Skills" includes only the skills I'm sure I have
