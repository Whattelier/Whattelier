Hi I'm **Whattelier**!

*≈2.5 years experience nerd*

I dev most of the time in python (I found it weird at first, now it's my main language for building projects)

# Quick Presentation 👋
- ✨ I love `Python 🐍, Rust ⚙️, Java ☕, Kotlin 💪☕, C# 🥸(🎮☕), C 👴 and C++ 💪👴🎮` ❤️
- 👀 I think that `AI 🤖 is and will be a very powerfull TOOL` 💪
- ☝️ I `never stop to learn new (interesting) stuff 📖` 🤓
- 🖥️ I `love "computer tech" (idk if I should name it like that) in general!` 🔥

# Cool projects that you should check out 🔥
## Python related 🐍
### Tools 🛠️
- **Nuitka**: `Python* -> C -> "EXE" COMPILER`: https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka
- **Codon**: `Python -> "EXE" COMPILER**`, Performances around C/C++ (sometimes faster): https://github.com/exaloop/codon

*Supports Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11

**Does not support Windows yet

### Programming languages 💬
- **Nim**: A `python like compiled programming language*`: https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim
- **Mojo**: A `python superset`: https://github.com/modularml/mojo

*It's another programming language with a real learning curve, it's not a compiled python

# I **HATE** you if
- You ask me to fix your printer
- You ask me to be part of a shitty marketing project or something like that, as a developer

# Notes
- C++ is not just a better C, they are different on some points and both cool for different purposes
- Don't think that the "💪👴" is better than "👴", the emojis are a little saracstic, and the "💪" just means "superset"
- Don't worry the emojis are there only because its my profile's presentation, I tough that putting no emojis would be boring and a little sad
